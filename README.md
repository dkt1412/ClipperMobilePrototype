ClipperMobilePrototype
======================

This project is an interface-only, Android-based prototype designed as part of MGMT 512, Summer 2013, Santa Clara University.
The prototype is aimed at users so that they can manage and use Clipper without a physical Clipper Card.

The application does NOT actually interact with any type of Clipper reader.
